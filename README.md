# ToBeOrNotToBe
To be, or not to be, that is not the question; but it's **"Is it delicious or not"**.

As I love pizza along with binge watching Silicon Vally(TV Series), 
What's better than modifying Jìan-Yáng's (Character in the show) hot dog or not App so that it can tell me that what I am eating is my lovely pizza or anything but not paradise.
